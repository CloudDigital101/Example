# Introduction

The discussion around climate change and global warming is dividing policy makers, scientists and the public. It is widely being recognized as a wicked problem, since there is no consensus on values and a lack of knowledge. There are some really different perspectives on this case and we will discuss the two most popular points of view.

The first perspective is all about the idea that humanity needs to take measures against global warming. This group would argue that mechanisms like extreme weather frequency, rising temperatures and melting ice caps are reasons to stand up against this climate change. To indicate this perspective we will give a confirmatory argument and an exploratory argument, both aided by visualizations based on data. Firstly, we will examine the rising temperatures and following we will analyze the data of CO2 emissions and energy sources to explore methods to mitigate the problem and show that humans indeed do have an impact.

The second perspective is more skeptical, viewing the hype around climate change as greatly exaggerated. While this group doesn’t deny the existence of climate change, they question the significant impact humanity has on it. They see climate change as part of a historical and natural cycle. To illustrate this viewpoint, we delve into temperature anomalies over the past 800,000 years. We explore how natural disasters, like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, have historically influenced the climate. This suggests that these natural events play a significant role in climate change, highlighting the need to consider nature’s powerful influence alongside human activity.
