# Work Distribution
We started the project by finding together the datasets and subject that we thought would be interesting and fit the assignment well. Quickly we came on the subject of climate change. Our approach was to consistently have a meeting with each other and gradually go through the assignment, to get the most out of each other by giving frequent feedback. And by having many meetings, we have been able to regularly divide (smaller) tasks, to ensure an equal workload and everyone was involved.

Achraf
Achraf made sure GIT (and setup around it) worked and was mostly responsible for the argument in the second perspective (including merging 2 datasets and the visualizations) about natural disasters influencing the climate.

Bram
Bram worked on the stacked barchart about electricity sources in the second argument of the first perspective. Also wrote the reflection and conclusions. 

Ian
Ian was responsible for the first argument and the corresponding visualization about (recent) temperature anomaly. Also for writing the introductions for the perspectives, summary and the preprocessing explanation. 

Richard
Richard worked on the world map and the visualization about the relationship between electricity sources and CO2 emissions (including merging the datasets). Also wrote the introduction and work distribution.

For the most part the text that corresponds to the visualization, was written by the maker of the visualization.
