# Reflection

During this project we have received feedback from our TA to improve our data story. We added captions to our graphs to make their purpose clear. We all wrote our own section in this data story, but we still had to turn it into one story to make it more fluent, so that is what we did. The text at the end of the first perspective was unreadable for our target audience, so we changed that to bring the same message but readable. After getting told that our second perspective was a little bit weak, we thought of another way to substantiate our argument. That is where the idea of using data about eruptions and earthquakes came in. Overall, the entire project went quite smooth. We agreed quite quickly on the idea that there is a lot of data out there about our climate which can be interpreted in more than 1 way which was perfect for this project. As mentioned before, whenever our TA gave us feedback we were quick to include this into our project to make it as good as possible.
